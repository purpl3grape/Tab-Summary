Tab Summary
<br>
<br>
This project was designed for checking Excel Reports and Tables for discrepencies in any calculations made by tabulating software, common in Market Research industries.
<br>
<br>
Specifically common calculation discrepencies arise when imposing desired weighted groups to normalize the data to better represent the population demographics. We call this, 'weighting' a data set. With weigthings applied to dataset totals / breakdowns it becomes a bit more complicated to track and check the data efficiently.

Furthermore this is just an example of how to implement Interop / Excel processes within a C# program to manipulate and automate Excel reporting and analysis.
